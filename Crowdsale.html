<h2><b>Im making an crowdsale for people to invest in the website, the coins will be very limited and will act like shares, so you earn money by holding the coins.</b> </h2>
<h3><b>If you hold 1% of the coins you earn 1% of all earnings from the website, from fees, adds and sponsors.
    Exactly how you will be paid is not set yet, the choice is between giving out coins to holders or burn coins monthly for increased value.</b></h3>
<h3><b>The token is called Droplet, and there will be a total supply of 100 000 tokens.
Not all of the coins will be sold in this crowdsale, but there will be sales later when the coin is more complete.
Therefore this is an opportunity to buy Droplet tokens before it gains its potential value</b></h3>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Droplet is an ERC-20 token, so it runs on the Ethereum network as a smartcontract.</b></h2>
<h3><b>The early crowdsale is small because we only need money to fund further development of the website.
The website will be a place where people can buy and sell cryptocurrencies for USD/EUR/JPY in real time,
easily, where the site has the money and the cryptocurrencies so you buy instantly and sell instantly with 0.5% fee.</b></h3>
&nbsp;
    <h2><b>The tokens will be rewarded automatically to the address you sent Ethereum from.</b></h2>
<h3><b>Be aware, most exchanges doesn't support the token yet so I recommend you to be using a private wallet and NOT a thirdparty wallet like an exchange or Coinbase.
Remember to send Ethereum and not other cryptocurrencies to the adress.</b></h3>
